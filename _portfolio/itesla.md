The [iPST](http://github.com/itesla) project aims at developing of an open-source toolkit dedicated to large power grid security analysis. It is dedicated to:
- Power system simulations, be they static through Power Flows and Optimal Power Flows or dynamic through dynamic power system simulators.
- Power system data-mining thanks to big-data databases that allow storing time-series of power system related data.
